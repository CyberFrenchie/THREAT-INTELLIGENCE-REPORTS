## **3. Infrastructure Analysis**

### **3.1 WHOIS Information**

**IP Address:** 45.74.46.39  
**Owner:** Secure Internet LLC  
**Organization:** Secure Internet LLC (SIL-69)  
**Country (WHOIS):** United States  
**Abuse Contact:** [admin@pointtoserver.com](mailto:admin@pointtoserver.com)  
üìå **Note:** The organization claims to be a hosting provider. The presence of a VPN service (PureVPN) suggests possible anonymization.

---

### **3.2 Shodan Scan**

**IP Address:** 45.74.46.39  
**Location (Shodan):** Frankfurt am Main, Germany  
**Operating System:** Windows Server 2012 R2 (Build 6.3.9600)  
**Organization:** COREBACKBONE-SE  
**Open Ports:**

- **5985/tcp (WinRM)** ‚Üí Used for **Windows Remote Management**, possibly exploited for remote access.

üìå **Note:** This suggests the machine is **remotely accessible**, which aligns with Remcos RAT functionality.

---

### **3.3 IPInfoDB Geolocation**

**Location (IPInfoDB):** Stockholm, Sweden  
**ISP:** Secure Internet LLC  
**Domain:** purevpn.com  
**Usage Type:** Data Center / Web Hosting / Transit

üìå **Geolocation Discrepancy:**

- **Shodan:** Germany
- **IPInfoDB:** Sweden
- **WHOIS:** US-based organization

The conflicting locations indicate **this IP is likely a VPN exit node**, making it harder to determine the actual attacker‚Äôs origin.

## **4. Malware Sample Analysis**

### **4.1 Sample Details**

**File Name:** `d9015194f6a3d0f5b47447924127b970690bb1ea0d957ce412e0c83ba604c9aa.zip`  
**MD5:** `66D40E6537F67347E9450E064A8CED33`  
**SHA-1:** `602E60900DC364E9A2F3FF3620FAB500F5CE6110`  
**SHA-256:** `B965E1923D49B795629EC84D738A6A0C4ECC9F3D0820779E0A54A7825951FDD6`  
**File Type:** Zip archive data, AES Encrypted  
**Analysis Date:** March 5, 2025, 15:03:43  
**Analysis Environment:** Windows 10 Professional (build: 19045, 64 bit)

### **4.2 Behavioral Analysis**

The **Any.Run** analysis indicates that the sample exhibits behavior consistent with the **Remcos Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**. Key observations include:

- **Process Execution:** The malware initiates multiple processes to establish control over the infected system.
- **Network Activity:** Attempts to connect to external servers, possibly for command-and-control (C2) communication.
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** Modifies system registries and drops files to maintain persistence across reboots.

### **4.3 Network Indicators**

- **IP Address:** 45.74.46.39
    - **Location:** Frankfurt am Main, Germany
    - **Operating System:** Windows Server 2012 R2 (build 6.3.9600)
    - **Organization:** COREBACKBONE-SE
    - **Open Port:** 5985/tcp (WinRM)

üìå **Note:** The presence of port 5985 (WinRM) suggests remote management capabilities, which could be exploited by attackers.

### **4.4 Recommendations**

‚úÖ **Isolate Infected Systems:** Immediately disconnect any systems exhibiting these indicators from the network.  
‚úÖ **Conduct Comprehensive Scans:** Use updated antivirus and anti-malware solutions to perform thorough scans of all systems.  
‚úÖ **Monitor Network Traffic:** Implement network monitoring to detect unusual outbound connections, particularly to IP addresses associated with Remcos RAT.  
‚úÖ **Update Security Measures:** Ensure all systems are patched and up-to-date to mitigate vulnerabilities exploited by RATs.

## **5. Possible Attribution**

üîπ **Possibilities:**

- This IP could be part of a **Remcos C2 network**.
- The **VPN service (PureVPN)** could be used to **mask attacker activity**.
- The **Windows Server 2012 R2 machine** may be compromised and exploited.

---

## **6. Recommended Actions**

‚úÖ **Blocklist the IP (45.74.46.39)** if confirmed malicious  
‚úÖ **Monitor network traffic** for connections to Remcos RAT domains or C2 IPs  
‚úÖ **Check endpoints for the malware hash** using EDR/XDR tools  
‚úÖ **Engage with PureVPN/Secure Internet LLC** to report abuse

---

## **7. Conclusion**

The investigation suggests that **45.74.46.39** is a **potentially malicious IP**, either being used as **a VPN exit node for attacker activity** or acting as a **Remcos RAT C2 server**. The presence of **port 5985 (WinRM)** suggests remote management capabilities, which could be exploited by attackers. Further monitoring and reporting to relevant security agencies are recommended.
